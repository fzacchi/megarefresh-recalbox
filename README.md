## Welcome to Zak's MegaRefresh Script - Recalbox version



### What?

A set of scripts for Recalbox on the Raspberry Pi that enable dynamic, game-specific refresh rate switching on standard LCD monitors.



### Why?

We tend to think of LCD monitors without Freesync or G-Sync as being able to only run at their native ~60 Hz refresh rate, but in reality they can switch to other rates with the right invocations. So far it's been possible to use that feature in a retrogaming context only on MAME setups on PC. With MegaRefresh the Raspberry Pi can now do it as well, across all the Recalbox systems and emulators.

In practice this allows PAL home computer systems, PAL consoles and especially arcade ROMs to run against a monitor that's synced to the game's refresh rate instead of being fixed at 60 Hz, with a deviation of no more than 0.5 Hz in the worst case.  Arcade games span a refresh range of 50 to 63 Hz and most LCD monitors can cover that.

It's astonishing how running a game at the right refresh rate can result in such a drastic difference in perceived emulation quality all else being equal. The result is that every game runs at the proper speed, with the music at the right pitch, and more importantly scrolls smoothly.

One thing that both home computer and arcade games always have had is perfectly fluid scrolling, no matter how rudimentary the graphics were. That's lost on a fixed refresh setup, and it's back with MegaRefresh. Compare the spinning character carousel shown when inserting a coin in Mortal Kombat, the first level in Shadow of the Beast on the Amiga, any PAL C64 scroller or any Neo Geo game with and without it to see the difference. Transparency or shadow effects relying on fast flickering look as they're supposed to again.

Details like that have been bothering me since way back, wondering why all those early MAME games played on 85 Hz 800x600 VGA monitors just didn't feel like I remembered them at all. I knew that the blocky look was due to the lack of scanlines and other CRT artifacts, but had no solution for the choppy scrolling. What's indeed puzzling is how long we put up with fixed refresh instead of this.

Think of MegaRefresh as CRT SwitchRes-lite for everyone on an LCD monitor. It's not the perfect solution that modeline generation on CRT is, but it's way simpler and immensely more practical. Coupled with a good CRT shader it brings the feel of PAL systems and nonstandard refresh rate games from subjectively unbearable to close enough to be enjoyable, at least for my taste. Unlike a CRT rig it needs no calibration, no extra hardware, no configuration, no compromise settings between modes and no setup apart from the initial installation.  Speaking of which ...



### How?



#### Installation instructions

You'll need a working internet connection on Recalbox; get to the command prompt with PuTTY or other method of your choice and type or paste

`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fzacchi/megarefresh-recalbox/master/install.sh | bash`

This version of the script has been tested on Recalbox 6 only. Due to Recalbox's architecture it's probably best to reinstall it after each major system update.



#### Usage

There is no configuration needed after installation, everything should be completely automatic. MegaRefresh will launch each game or system at the proper refresh and set the 60 Hz standard one upon exiting back into EmulationStation. It will auto-detect and maintain your monitor's native resolution.

It's recommended to disable bezels and use integer scaling if you wish to use MegaRefresh together with the Retro or Scanline shaders, but feel free to experiment.

There is still some scrolling micro-stuttering at times even when using MegaRefresh: setting Threaded Video to OFF in the RetroArch cores seems to help, if your Pi is powerful enough (3B+ is).

The experimental lr-mame2003-plus core currently doesn't work as expected with the standard settings, causing very choppy scrolling. The fix is setting "Bypass audio skew" as disabled in the core's quick menu/options section (last on the bottom). The option is present only in very recent builds of the core, since 1.7.6 onwards. Every other libretro arcade core works as it should.

The list of systems and arcade games ROMs affected by MegaRefresh is kept in two files, `/recalbox/scripts/megarefresh/refreshlist.txt` and `systems.txt`. The format (`romname refresh` and `systemname refresh`) is self-explanatory. 

There is an additional `skip.txt` file in the same directory. MegaRefresh will be completely bypassed for any system, emulator or rom on that list. 

When adding systems or ROMs or changing included ones make sure to round the game or system refresh frequency to the nearest integer value.

To modify the system Recalbox must be mounted as read/write first, by typing

`mount -o remount,rw /`

For console systems with mixed romsets in the same directory (with both PAL and NTSC ROMs, or Europe and USA/Japan/World ROMs) MegaRefresh will attempt to determine the ROM's region and corresponding video mode by parsing the filename looking for tags like (PAL),  (Europe), etc.

If you get some kind of 'mode not supported' OSD message or Recalbox hangs on a black screen after game launch your monitor isn't compatible, unfortunately. In that case reboot from the command line or power cycle, at the next boot Recalbox will start at the usual 60 Hz frequency and you can disable MegaRefresh.



#### Hardware Compatibility

All testing and development have been done on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. If you're using older Pis make sure to update the firmware to the latest version.

MegaRefresh has been tested with the following monitors:

- Samsung S27C350H: Working
- LG M2062D: Working
- Asus VK266: Working
- Samsung T240HD: Doesn't work when using the HDMI input. A 3€ HDMI to DVI adapter on Amazon and using the DVI input on the monitor solves the problem.
- LG M1717TM: 4:3, DVI-only. Works perfectly with an HDMI to DVI adapter.

Please test it with every monitor and Pi version out there and let me know what works and what doesn't.



#### Donate

MegaRefresh is the result of a lot of trial and error, research and experimentation. In particular getting from a working proof of concept to its present release version for three platforms has proven to require a substantial amount of work.

I'm delighted to finally be able to contribute something back to the emulation community, but if you wish to show a token of appreciation and support further development please consider donating any amount of your choice at https://www.paypal.me/zacchi

Thanks :)



#### The Future

Now that smart refresh sync and CRT shaders are in the 'good enough' phase, the more urgent priorities on the Pi are audio latency and input lag. Beam raced vsync or the new Rivatuner scanline sync should help with input lag, but more importantly we need better audio drivers and a better audio pipeline to get below the ghastly ~60ms of latency we have now, ideally in the sub-10ms range. The PortAudio implementation in GroovyMAME that got latency in the 10ms range does wonders for responsiveness.
